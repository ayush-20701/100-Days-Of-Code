# 100 Days of Coding - Data Structures and Algorithms
Welcome to my 100 Days of Coding journey focused on solving Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) questions daily. In this repository, you'll find solutions to various DSA problems along with screenshots of my code and explanations.

## Motivation
The primary motivation behind this project is to enhance my problem-solving skills, deepen my understanding of fundamental data structures and algorithms, and track my progress over 100 days.

## Structure
* Each day, I'll be solving at least one DSA problem.
* Solutions will be implemented in a programming language of choice (e.g., Python, Java, C++).
* The solutions will be well-documented and accompanied by explanations where necessary.
* Screenshots of code and execution results will be provided for each solution.
## How to Use This Repository
* **Browse Solutions:** Navigate through the repository to explore solutions to various DSA problems. Each day's solution will be stored in a separate directory named according to the date (e.g., Day01, Day02, etc.).
* **Contribute:** Contributions are welcome! Feel free to submit pull requests for bug fixes, optimizations, or additional problem solutions.
* **Learn:** Use this repository as a resource to learn about different algorithms and techniques for solving DSA problems.
## Connect
Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn if you have any questions, suggestions, or just want to say hi!

## Acknowledgments
I'd like to express my gratitude to my mentor Love Babbar, the online coding platforms like LeetCode, Coding Ninjas, GeeksForGeeks, that provide valuable learning materials and practice problems.

_Let's embark on this journey together and grow our DSA skills one day at a time!_

_**Happy Coding! ðŸš€**_
